    "# Agent Based Modeling: Virus on a Network\n",
    "This model is based on the NetLogo model Virus on a Network (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/VirusonaNetwork) and demonstrates the spread of a virus through a social network.  It consists of 3 compartments: $S$, the number of susceptible individuals, $I$, the number of infected individuals, and $R$, the number of recovered (and immune) individuals.  (An assumption is that individuals have life-long immunity, so this would not be the appropriate model for the flu or for COVID-19.)\n",
    "The code below is explained in pieces.  It will need to be run in Netlogo to execute it (it can't be run from this notebook).  Stated alternatively, this Jupyter notebook is used for an explanantion of the code, but the code can be either run in NetLogo if that is installed locally on your machine, or can be run in the NetLogo webbrowser at this site: http://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/models/Sample%20Models/Networks/Virus%20on%20a%20Network.nlogo."

    "### How it works\n",
    "This model simulates:\n",
    "- Agents on a network that can get infected and recover or become immune.\n",
    "- Virus spreading through links (edges).\n",
    "- Stochastic recovery and immunity behavior.\n",
    "- Visual feedback using colors:\n",
    "    - Red = infected\n",
    "    - Blue = susceptible\n",
    "    - Gray = resistant\n",
    "    \n",
    "The model defines several sliders that allow the user to customize some parameters in the model.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "At each time step (tick), each infected node (red) attempts to infect all of its neighbors.  Susceptible neighbors (blue) will be infected with a probability given by the VIRUS-SPREAD-CHANCE slider.  Resistant nodes (gray) can't be infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infected nodes don't know they are infected-- the VIRUS-CHECK-FREQUENCY slider determines the frequency that nodes check to see if they are infected.  Once detected, the infection is cleared (recovered with a probability determined by the RECOVERY-CHANCE slider), and there is some probability that the node will become resistant (gray) to the virus, determined by the GAIN-RESISTANCE-CHANCE slider.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node becomes resistant, the links between it and its neighbors are darkened to indicate it can no longer spread the infection."

    "### Run the Model\n",
    "Before looking at the code, lets look at a few runs of the model.\n",
    "1. Set the sliders:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the NUMBER-OF-NODES and the AVERAGE-NODE-DEGREE (average number of links coming out of each node).\n",
    "\n",
    "The network that is created is based on the Euclidean distance between nodes. A node is randomly selected and connected to the nearest node that it is not already connected to. This process is repeated until the network has the correct number of links to give the specified average node degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The INITIAL-OUTBREAK-SIZE slider determines how many of the nodes will start the simulation infected with the virus.  (You will see them as red.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The VIRUS-SPREAD-CHANCE, VIRUS-CHECK-FREQUENCY, RECOVERY-CHANCE, and GAIN-RESISTANCE-CHANCE sliders should be set, too.  VIRUS-SPREAD-CHANCE is a parameter related to infectiousness, and the RECOVERY-CHANCE is a parameter related to immunity (or immune/virus interaction).  The GAIN-RESISTANCE-CHANCE parameter relates to if an individual will become resistant.  In this model, it is life-long resistance, but of course, in reality, we often have waning immunity (which is why there are COVID_19 boosters), and this can vary by age and other characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Press SETUP to create the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Press GO to run the model. The model will stop running once the virus has completely died out.  (You can see the time in terms of ticks at the top.)\n",

    "   - comments are done with ;;\n",
    "   - variable names that return true of false have a ? ending their name, e.g., `infected?`\n",
    "   - NetLogo uses `ask` to give instructons to specific agents\n",

    "   - there is no `return` keyword.  If you want a reporter to give a value, you define it as a reporter procedure\n",
    "   - multiple agents operate simulataneously.  In one tick (time unit), turtles, patches, and links can all run their code via `ask`.\n",
    "It is also good to know that many researchers publish their models and those models can be built upon (reference appropriately).  I give links you might want to explore in the Reference section of this notebook. \n",

    "It can be very useful to collect data from multiple runs of a NetLogo model and analyze or visualize the data using Python.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Batch Runs: Automates multiple runs of the model with different parameter settings.\n",
    "- Parameter Sweeps: Vary one or more parameters across a range of values (e.g., test 5 different birth rates).\n",
    "- Replications: Run the same set of parameters multiple times to account for stochasticity (randomness).\n",
    "- Data Collection: Automatically collects values from reporters (like the number of infected) at each step or at the end of the run.\n",
    "- Export Options: Results can be saved as CSV files for later analysis (e.g., in Excel, R, or Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "This cannot be used from the NetLogo Web, but can be used in NetLogo if it is downloaded to your machine.  The dowload is free.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we could vary two parameters in the model by setting `initial-outbreak-size: 1 5 10` and\n",
    "`chance-recovery: 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.2` which gives 12 combinations to test (3 choices for the first parameter and 4 choices for the second).  We can choose metrics to record (\"reporters\") such as  how many infected and how many recovered\n",
    "- `count turtles with [infected?]`\n",
    "- `count turtles with [recovered?]`\n",
    "\n",
    "BehaviorSpace will save the results as a `.csv` file where each row corresponds to a run (we might do multiple runs to account for stochasticity in the model) and includes the parameters being used, the values of the reporters and the run number.  You can then use this data to create graphs, or calculate statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a Python package (pyNetLogo) that will let you control NetLogo from within Python, and can be used as an alternative to BehaviorSpace.  It will require you to have the model `.nlogo` file saved locally.  You can export a model from the NetLogo web by choosing the Export:NetLogo button (top right of screen).  This will save a `.nlogo` file, and you will need to note its path.  I am just learning about this, and find it a bit fussy, but feel free to explore it."

    "This NetLogo model sets up a simple world where butterflies move around a hilly landscape defined by patch elevations. The variable `q` is declared as a global, which means it has the same value for all turtles and patches. In this case, `q` represents the probability that a butterfly will move directly to the highest surrounding patch rather than wandering randomly. Each patch has its own state variable `elevation`, which is calculated from a sine function of its `(pxcor, pycor)` coordinates. This function produces a patterned landscape with repeating hills and valleys, and the elevation is mapped to patch color using a green scale so you can visually track the terrain. During `setup`, the model clears everything, assigns elevations and colors to patches, creates 500 butterflies at random starting positions, and sets `q` to 0.4 (meaning butterflies will follow the “go uphill” rule 40% of the time).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once `setup` is complete, the scheduler (`go`) drives the simulation. Each tick represents one unit of time, and at each tick every butterfly executes the `move` procedure. The movement decision uses `ifelse random-float 1.0 < q`. This condition is true with probability q and false with probability 1 – q. When true, the butterfly uses the built-in `uphill` primitive to move toward the neighbor patch with the highest elevation. Otherwise, the butterfly chooses a random neighbor with `move-to one-of neighbors`. Because of this probabilistic rule, the butterflies sometimes act purposefully by climbing hills and other times wander randomly. The simulation continues until 1000 ticks have passed, at which point it stops automatically. Overall, the model illustrates how simple rules combining probability and the environment can produce diverse and interpretable movement patterns.\n",

For the model to serve its scientific purpuse (understanding the emergence of virtual corridors) we need additional outputs to quantify the width of the corridors.  We also might be interested in a realistic landscape instead of an artificial landscape we create.  So instead of using the model as a simulator, we need to produce quantitative output that can be used to answer questions.\n",

This means we need a way to determine if a patch has been visited by any butterfly, and need a way to know where each butterfly starts and ends.  Details on this bulleted below.\n",
    "- vary $q$ and see how this changes the corridor width.  To do this, using the interface tab, add a slider (under widgets) for $q$.  Let $q$ vary in $[0,1]$ with step size $.01$.  When you do this, your code will give you a warning-- you need to remove $q$ from the global variables in the code.  We also need to remove the line in `setup` that initializes $q$.  (If left, the code will use this value instead of the value with the slider.)  I commented these lines out so you can see the change.\n",

    "- Run this in NetLogo.  Run it for a very low $q$ (choose a value with the slider), a medium $q$ and a high $q$.  What do you notice visually?  How does corridor width change?\n",
    "- NetLogo has a cool feature called Behavior Space which is like a build in experiemnt manager.  Instead of manually changing sliders, running the model, recording results, it can do it automatically for you.  It collects results in a CSV file for later analysis.  Google this to get an idea of how it works.  This can be quite powerful if you have many parameters.  Varying parameters like this is called a parameter sweep and this can be helpful to understand the sensititvity (does a small change in a parameter cause a big change in output) and to to discover thresholds (akin to bifurcations for ODEs)."
